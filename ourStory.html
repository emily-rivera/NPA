                        In the spring of 2006, David and Charlotte Hamblin were assigned by the LDS Church to trabel
                        to Africa and look for ways to help the people in Mozambique. Mozambique is one of the
                        poorest countries in Africa and neglected by many organizations due to political
                        instability. However, the Hamblins were moved by the amazing people and their need. After
                        spending 7 years doing several different projects in agriculture, the Hamblins saw a need to
                        help women get a better education and technical skills. Women and girls in Mozambique were
                        not treated the same as men and most of the girls did not make it past the 8th grade. The
                        women had a great desire to improve their economical situation, but lacked the right skills
                        to do so.

                        their new skills to change their life. The center now offers cooking, sewing, literacy,
                        English and computer training and entrepreneurship courses. It is also responsible for
                        sponsoring and working with 120 girls from three different schools. The sponsorship program
                        helps pay for girls school fees, backpacks, school supplies, uniforms and an additional 3
                        hours a day of English immersion and computer training. The girls in the program have an 80%

                        The Boane Women's Center has become a great place of refuge and hope for the women in the
                        surrounding areas. The Center has seen great success in the people that have come through
                        the programs. Many people have gained employment and started successful businesses using the
                        skills they obtained through the courses. Our vision is a world where everyone has the
                        opportunity to succeed financially through hard work, honesty and the entrepreneurial
                        spirit. The Boane Women's Center is helping that vision become a reality.
